# BetterPMManager

BetterPMManager is designed as a successor to kerbybit's PMManager module, with a cleaner UI, saving messages locally so you can read them even after restarting your game, and other QoL features.

## Commands

 - `/betterpm` - Opens the BetterPMManager GUI
 - `/bpm` - Shorthand way of typing /betterpm, also opens the BetterPMManager GUI
 - `/betterpmm` - Opens the BetterPMManager settings menu

## Features

 - Send DMs to your friends in a fancy menu!
 - Open DMs from inside the menu with the button at the top
 - Save messages locally (I cannot see them) for viewing even after you relaunch your game
 - Use arrow keys/click on the input bar to edit at a specific place in your message, and click the X to the right of the input bar to clear it
 - Automatically open a new DM if someone messages you, so you don't have to manually open it
 - Red circle to indicate unread messages
 - Use the hotkeys 1-9 to quickly switch between talking to different players
 - Click on a DM in chat to open the menu \[TOGGLEABLE IN SETTINGS]
 - Hide DMs in chat when in the menu \[TOGGLEABLE IN SETTINGS]
